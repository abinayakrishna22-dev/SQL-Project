## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using **SQL**. The dataset includes information about **customers, orders, order details, products, and employees**.
The objective of this project is to answer **business-critical questions** such as identifying top customers, sales trends, employee performance, and customer lifetime value.

The queries are designed to demonstrate **intermediate-to-advanced SQL skills**, including:

* Aggregations
* Window functions
* Ranking
* Joins across multiple tables
* Time-based analysis

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses 5 relational tables:

* **Customers** – Customer details
* **Orders** – Order-level information
* **Order\_Details** – Line items for each order
* **Products** – Product details including category
* **Employees** – Sales representatives
